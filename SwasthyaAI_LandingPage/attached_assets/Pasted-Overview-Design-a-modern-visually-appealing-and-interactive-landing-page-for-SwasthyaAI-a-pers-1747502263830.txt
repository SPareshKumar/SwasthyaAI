Overview:
Design a modern, visually appealing, and interactive landing page for "SwasthyaAI," a personalized health companion platform. The theme should be fresh, clean, and highly attractive with soft shadows, glassmorphism cards, and rounded corners. Use subtle motion animations such as scroll-triggered animations, hover effects, and text animations to enhance user engagement. The design should feel smooth, welcoming, and professional with a focus on wellness, technology, and personalization.

1. General Design Style
Use soft shadows to create depth without harsh contrasts.

Apply glassmorphism effect on cards: translucent backgrounds with blurred content behind, subtle borders, and light reflections.

Rounded corners with a 2xl border-radius for all major UI elements (cards, buttons, input fields).

Use a light, airy color palette with soothing blues, whites, and accent colors.

Typography: Use a clean sans-serif font with distinct sizes for headings and body text. Headings should be bold and large; body text should be easy to read and lighter in weight.

Responsive design for all screen sizes.

2. Navigation Bar (Sticky on scroll)
Left aligned: Logo with text "SwasthyaAI" (stylish, modern font, possibly with a subtle health/AI icon integrated).

Right aligned menu items:

Home

Features

Explore (Dropdown menu with sub-items: Diet, BMI, Fitness Tracker)

Contact

Menu items should smoothly scroll to the relevant page sections when clicked.

Hover effect: Underline or highlight menu item on hover with a subtle animation.

3. Hero Section
Centered large headline text:
"Your Personalized Health Companion"

Big font size, main focus of the page.

Apply a subtle text effect (like gradient fill or slight shadow/glow).

Subheadline 1 (smaller font, lighter color):
"From healthy meals to calorie tracking — it’s all here"

Subheadline 2 (animated, italicized):
"Say goodbye to generic plans and take control of your wellness."

Animate this line so letters appear one by one from right to left.

Background: Soft, light abstract shapes or very subtle health-themed imagery (like faint leaf patterns or fluid shapes) that do not distract from the text.

4. Feature Flashcards Section (Animated Grid)
Layout: 2 or 3 rows of cards, max 6 cards total.

Cards use flip animation or hover reveal effect where the card flips or slides to reveal text on hover.

Style: Glassmorphism with soft shadows and rounded corners.

Hover effects on buttons: gentle scaling and glowing outlines.

Interactive flashcards with subtle 3D tilt effect on mouse movement.

For the animated text in the hero section, ensure each letter's animation timing is smooth and easily readable.

Use CSS transitions for all interactive elements to maintain smoothness.
